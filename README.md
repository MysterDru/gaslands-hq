# Gaslands HQ
Hey there. It's been a while. Welcome to your new HQ. Need to manage your ride, or make a new one? This is the spot.

## What is Gaslands?

Gaslands is a miniatures game set on post-apocalyptic Earth, where players compete to earn a ticket off world by racing and fighting in armed, modified vehicles. Think Mad Max, only with Matchbox cars.

Learn more on the [Gaslands website](https://gaslands.com/) or
    [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gaslands/). 
    
Buy the game from your FLGS or direct from [Osprey Publishing](https://ospreypublishing.com/gaslands). It's a bargain for the amount of fun it delivers.
